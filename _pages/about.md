Hello, this is Zhaoyu Lou, a PhD candidate and HKPFS winner at The Chinese University of Hong Kong under Dr. **Martin Stolterfoht**. And I had my bachelor in Physics Department at Wuhan University, began my journey in perovskite photovoltaic under guidance of Dr. **Zhiping Wang**. You could find some of my notes at [Xiaohongshu](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/6364b218000000001f01a85e).

Research Interests
======
**Perovskite Photovoltaic; Charge Dynamics; Characterization; Drift-Diffusion Simulation**

My current research focuses on some interesting phenomenon in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and optimization of efficient and stable PSCs. For example, the ions and traps in perovskite solar cells, and their role in device performance; hysteresis effect and other characterization methods. Further, build up a machine to distinguish between them and link to device stability.
