Hello, this is Zhaoyu Lou, currently studying in School of Physics and Technology at Wuhan University (China Mainland) as an undergraduate student. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Zhiping Wang (王植平-武汉大学物理科学与技术学院 (whu.edu.cn)) and Martin Stolterfoht (Electronic Engineering Department, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (cuhk.edu.hk)), for my undergraduate research and summer research respectively. You can find my CV (cv document) here.

Research Interests
======
My current research focuses on the light management and aging process of perovskite solar cells. For my light management project, funded by Nature Science Foundation of China (news from university{15位入选！国家自然科学基金首次资助优秀本科生-武汉大学新闻网 (whu.edu.cn)}), aimed to reduce optical loss in perovskite based device and build up relate simulation model. And another project is about to investigate the role of mobile ions and shallow traps in frequency dependent PCE. In a word, simulation, characterization, fabrication of perovskite solar cells and relate semiconductor technology, with a focus on physics aspect. I wish I can devote my talent in this area and application of such a promising technology.
